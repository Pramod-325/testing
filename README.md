# ðŸ“¦ Pull Requests Guide

## What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a way to propose changes to a repository. When you open a pull request, you're requesting that someone reviews and merges your changes into the main project.

Pull requests let us:
- Review code before itâ€™s merged
- Discuss and refine features or fixes
- Keep the main branch stable and production-ready
